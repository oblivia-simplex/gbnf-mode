1 Introduction
**************

GBNF Mode is a GNU Emacs major mode for editing GBNF grammars.  Presently
it provides basic syntax and font-locking for GBNF files.  GBNF notation
is supported exactly form as it was first announced in the ALGOL 60
report.

   Bellow canonical GBNF notation represented with a GBNF is presented.
The syntax of the GBNF has been carefully copied from Revised ALGOL 60
report.  For more see <http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm>.

     <syntax>         ::= <rule> | <rule> <syntax>
     <rule>           ::= <opt-ws> < <rule-name> > <opt-ws>
                          ::= <opt-ws> <expression> <line-end>
     <opt-ws>         ::= <space> <opt-ws> | <empty>
     <expression>     ::= <list> | <list> <opt-ws> <or> <opt-ws>
                          <expression>

     <list>           ::= <term> | <term> <opt-ws> <list>
     <term>           ::= <literal> | < <rule-name> >

2 Installation
**************

GBNF Mode known to work with GNU Emacs 25.1 and later.  GBNF Mode may work
with older versions of Emacs, or with other flavors of Emacs (e.g.
XEmacs) but this is not guaranteed.  Bug reports for problems related to
using GBNF Mode with older versions of Emacs will most like not be
addressed.

2.1 Installing from Elpa or Melpa
=================================

GBNF Mode is available from Elpa, Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you haven’t
used Emacs’ package manager before, then it is high time you familiarize
yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see
*note (emacs)Packages::.  Then add one of the archives to
‘package-archives’:

   • To use Elpa:

     (require 'package)
     (package-initialize)

   • For those who want only formal, tagged releases use Melpa Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)

   • For those who want rolling releases as they happen use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
     (package-initialize)

   Melpa tracks GBNF Mode’s Git repository and updates relatively soon
after each commit or formal release.  For more detail on setting up see
MELPA Getting Started (https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).

   Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using ‘M-x’ ‘package-refresh-contents’ ‘RET’.
Finally, use ‘M-x’ ‘package-list-packages’ ‘RET’ to get to the package
listing and install ‘gbnf-mode’ from there.

   There are several ways to install ‘gbnf-mode’ after package
initialization:

   • You can install ‘gbnf-mode’ manually by adding following to your
     init file:

     (unless (package-installed-p 'gbnf-mode)
         (package-refresh-contents)
         (package-install 'gbnf-mode))

   • To use Cask (https://cask.github.io/) add following to your ‘Cask’
     file:

     (source melpa)
     (depends-on "gbnf-mode")

   • To install ‘gbnf-mode’ using ‘use-package’ add following to your
     init file:

     (use-package gbnf-mode
       :ensure t
       ;; To use MELPA Stable use ":pin mepla-stable",
       ;; to use ELPA remove ":pin" line
       :pin melpa
       :mode "\\.gbnf\\'")

2.2 Installing using El-get
===========================

If you use el-get, just create a recipe file ‘gbnf.rcp’:

     (:name gbnf-mode
      :website "https://github.com/sergeyklay/gbnf-mode"
      :description "GBNF Mode: A major mode for editing GBNF grammars"
      :type github
      :pkgname "sergeyklay/gbnf-mode")

   Then add it to a directory present in ‘el-get-recipe-path’.  Then,
use ‘M-x’ ‘el-get-install’ ‘RET’ ‘gbnf-mode’ ‘RET’ or add to your init
file:

     (el-get-bundle gbnf-mode)


File: gbnf-mode.info,  Node: Installing from the Git Repository,  Prev: Installing using El-get,  Up: Installation

2.3 Installing from the Git Repository
======================================

GBNF Mode depends only on the ‘cl-lib’, which is bundled with GNU Emacs.
Thus you don’t have to install any additional library to satisfy GBNF
Mode dependencies.  Below are simple steps to install GBNF Mode using
manual approach:

   Clone the GBNF Mode repository:

     $ git clone https://github.com/sergeyklay/gbnf-mode.git \
       ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/gbnf-mode

   Add this to your init file:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/gbnf-mode")

   Add either of the two following lines to your initialization file.
The first only loads GBNF Mode when necessary, the 2nd always during
startup of GNU Emacs:

     (autoload 'gbnf-mode "gbnf-mode" nil t)
     ;; OR
     (require 'gbnf-mode)


File: gbnf-mode.info,  Node: Usage,  Next: Customizing,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Usage
*******

By default any file that matches the glob ‘*.gbnf’ is automatically
opened in ‘gbnf-mode’.  To toggle the mode in the current buffer use
‘M-x’ ‘gbnf-mode’ ‘RET’.


File: gbnf-mode.info,  Node: Customizing,  Next: Project Links,  Prev: Usage,  Up: Top

4 Customizing
*************

There are not so much customization options yet.

   To customize ‘abbrev-mode’ for ‘gbnf-mode’, simple add preffered
abbreviations to ‘gbnf-mode-abbrev-table’.

   If you want, you can go without any customizations at all.  The above
settings are the most bang for the buck in terms of customization.  So
users that typically don’t like customize a lot are advised to look at
these settings first.  To customize GBNF Mode options using textual GUI
system, use the following command: ‘M-x’ ‘customize-group’ ‘RET’ ‘gbnf’
‘RET’.
